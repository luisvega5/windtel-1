Code repository for the WindTel project.

WindTel is derived from the project's full name: Automated Wind Telemetry Acquisition System.
The purpose of this project is to develop an embedded technology approach to automate the acquisition of aerodynamic data
at the wind tunnel administered by Dr. Raúl Zapata and located at the Civil Engineering Department of the University of Puerto Rico - Mayagüez Campus,
as well as to facilitate the operation of said wind tunnel through an intuitive user interface.

This project originated in the course ICOM4217 - Embedded Systems Design, under the direction of Dr. Manuel Jiménez,
and is to be fleshed out in the Capstone course ICOM5047 - Computer Engineering Design.
